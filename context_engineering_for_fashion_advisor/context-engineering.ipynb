Based on the retail data I have, here's a general approach, but please tell me more about what you're looking for so I can tailor my advice:\n\nGeneral Strategies based on the data:\n\n*   **Focus on Best Sellers:** Increase marketing and promotional efforts around your \"Highly Profitable\" products (e.g., \"Men's Denim Jacket,\" \"Women's Floral Dress,\" \"Unisex White Sneakers,\" \"Women's Handbag\"). Ensure you have sufficient stock to meet demand. Consider running targeted ads or offering bundles to boost sales further.\n*   **Improve Underperforming Products:** Analyze why \"Less Profitable\" items like \"Kids' Hoodie,\" \"Men's Leather Belt,\" and \"Women's Winter Coat\" aren't performing as well. Is it the price point, the marketing, or the product itself? Consider discounts, updated product descriptions, or better placement in your store. For example, a seasonal item like the \"Women's Winter Coat\" might perform better with targeted promotions closer to winter.\n*   **Leverage Category Strengths:** The data shows products across Men, Women, Footwear, Accessories and Kids. Assess which categories are strongest overall and focus on expanding those lines or creating cross-promotional opportunities.\n\nTo give you more specific advice, can you tell me:\n\n*   **What specific products or categories are you most interested in improving?**\n*   **What kind of marketing or promotional activities have you tried in the past?**\n*   **Who is your target audience?**\n\ngemini-2.0-flash >  To increase your sales based on current fashion trends, focus on the following:\n\n*   **Offer Trending Products:** Prioritize top-selling apparel like t-shirts, hoodies, yoga pants, dresses, and jeans. Incorporate oversized clothing, boho chic elements (suede, larger bags), elevated sportswear, sheer styles, and asymmetrical designs into your product line.\n\n*   **Utilize Popular Colors, Fabrics, and Designs:** Use colors like yellow, icy blue, tea rose, chocolate brown, mocha mousse, and emerald green. Incorporate fabrics such as cotton (organic and recycled), silk, linen, polyester, Tencel, and suede. Offer designs with animal prints, polka dots, bold colors, aquatic influences, and scarf prints.\n\n*   **Leverage Social Media Trends:** Engage with platforms like Instagram and TikTok by using AR filters for virtual try-ons, creating short-form videos, and valuing user-generated content. Keep an eye on micro-trends and niche styles that can go viral quickly.\n\n*   **Target Specific Customer Segments:** Tailor your offerings to Gen Z (streetwear, Y2K revival, gender-fluid fashion, sustainability), Millennials (oversized apparel, comfortable styles), and the \"Pilates Moms\" (athleisure).\n\n*   **Emphasize Sustainability and Comfort:** Promote sustainable and eco-friendly clothing options, as well as athleisure styles.\n\n*   **Offer Personalization:** Provide customizable options and DIY elements in your products.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can align your product offerings with current fashion trends and increase your sales.\n\ngemini-2.0-flash >  Okay, let's synthesize the retail data and current fashion trends to create a plan to increase your sales.\n\n## Fashion Trend & Sales Increase Report\n\nHere's a detailed report combining your retail data with current fashion trends, aimed at boosting your sales:\n\n**1. Product and Category Recommendations Based on Trends**\n\nBased on the latest fashion trends, I recommend prioritizing and expanding your offerings in the following areas:\n\n*   **T-shirts and Hoodies:** These are top-selling apparel items. The retail data shows you already carry \"Men's Casual T-Shirt\" and \"Kids' Hoodie.\"\n    *   **Recommendation:** Expand your T-shirt and hoodie selection. Focus on:\n        *   **Oversized styles:** Cater to Gen Z and Millennial preferences.\n        *   **Customizable options:** Offer DIY elements or personalized prints.\n        *   **Sustainable materials:** Use organic or recycled cotton to appeal to eco-conscious consumers.\n        *   **Trendy colors:** Incorporate yellow, icy blue, tea rose, chocolate brown, mocha mousse, and emerald green.\n\n*   **Dresses:** \"Women's Floral Dress\" is already a strong seller.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Diversify your dress selection:\n        *   **Sheer styles:** Introduce dresses with see-through overlays or romantic gowns.\n        *   **Asymmetrical designs:** Offer dresses with one-shoulder cuts or flowy skirts.\n        *   **Aquatic influences:** Consider shades of blue, metallic colors, sequins, and fishtail maxi dresses.\n\n*   **Denim Jeans:** A classic staple that remains popular. You already stock \"Men's Denim Jacket.\"\n    *   **Recommendation:** Expand your denim offerings:\n        *   **Wide-cut trousers:** Cater to the oversized clothing trend.\n        *   **Sustainable denim:** Focus on recycled denim or eco-friendly washes.\n\n*   **Athleisure:**  Athleisure remains highly popular.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Leverage this trend. The store has \"Women's Running Shoes\" and \"Unisex Sports Cap\". Focus on products to promote Athleisure sales:\n        *   **Trendy Track pants.**\n        *   **Edgy racing jackets.**\n        *   **Promote Yoga pants and leggings.**\n\n*   **Accessories:**  \"Women's Handbag\" and \"Unisex Sports Cap\" are doing well, and accessories is a good area to branch out into new products.\n    *   **Recommendation:** Consider the \"Boho Chic\" comeback.\n        *   **Larger Bags made of Suede Fabrics.**\n\n**2. Detailed Product Analysis and Local News Impact**\n\nHere's a deeper dive into specific products, the rationale behind recommending them, and potential local news impacts:\n\n*   **Oversized Hoodies (Expanding on \"Kids' Hoodie\" and adding Men's/Women's):**\n    *   **Rationale:** Caters to Gen Z and Millennials, aligns with the comfort trend, and allows for personalization.\n    *   **Local News Impact (Using Remote News Agent):**\n        ```tool_code\n        remote_news_agent: search_news_report(query=\"local fashion trends and retail news\")\n        ```\n\n*   **Sheer Style Dresses (New Product Line):**\n    *   **Rationale:** Aligns with current runway trends and social media buzz, offering a unique and eye-catching product.\n    *   **Local News Impact (Using Remote News Agent):**\n        ```tool_code\n        remote_news_agent: search_news_report(query=\"local events and fashion shows\")\n        ```\n\n**3. Sales Increase Suggestions**\n\nHere are actionable strategies to boost sales based on the synthesized information:\n\n*   **Highlight Trending Products:**\n    *   Create prominent displays for oversized hoodies, sheer dresses, and other trending items.\n    *   Use mannequins to showcase these items in appealing outfits.\n*   **Run Targeted Promotions:**\n    *   Offer discounts on sustainable clothing options to attract eco-conscious consumers.\n    *   Bundle T-shirts and hoodies with customizable options for a higher perceived value.\n*   **Leverage Social Media:**\n    *   Create engaging content on Instagram and TikTok showcasing your trending products.\n    *   Use AR filters for virtual try-ons, especially for dresses and accessories.\n    *   Encourage user-generated content by running contests or featuring customer photos.\n*   **Personalize the Shopping Experience:**\n    *   Offer in-store customization options for T-shirts and hoodies.\n    *   Provide style consultations to help customers find the perfect outfit.\n*   **Address Underperforming Products:**\n    *   **Kids' Hoodie:**  If expanding the hoodie range as suggested above does not improve sales, consider whether the designs are appealing to kids and parents.  Are the colors, prints, and styles in line with current trends for children's clothing?\n    *   **Men's Leather Belt:** Leather belts may be declining in popularity. Consider replacing them with more fashionable alternatives like fabric belts or rope belts.\n    *   **Women's Winter Coat:** It is not winter, so sales should be low. Promote closer to winter.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can align your product offerings with current fashion trends, target specific customer segments, and create a more engaging shopping experience that drives sales growth.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sqlite3\n\ndef check_data_in_db():\n    with sqlite3.connect(\"my_agent_data.db\") as connection:\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\n        result = cursor.execute(\n            \"select app_name, session_id, author, content from events\"\n        )\n        print([_[0] for _ in result.description])\n        for each in result.fetchall():\n            print(each)\n\n\ncheck_data_in_db()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-28T13:27:12.775588Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-28T13:27:12.776262Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-28T13:27:12.783480Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-28T13:27:12.776235Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-28T13:27:12.782546Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"['app_name', 'session_id', 'author', 'content']\n('fashion_advisor', 'test-db-session-01', 'user', '{\"parts\": [{\"text\": \"How can I increase my sales\"}], \"role\": \"user\"}')\n('fashion_advisor', 'test-db-session-01', 'RetailDataAgent', '{\"parts\": [{\"function_call\": {\"id\": \"adk-3dee1600-d404-4f2b-92c5-531a1a1e6fe4\", \"args\": {}, \"name\": \"get_retail_data\"}}], \"role\": \"model\"}')\n('fashion_advisor', 'test-db-session-01', 'RetailDataAgent', '{\"parts\": [{\"function_response\": {\"id\": \"adk-3dee1600-d404-4f2b-92c5-531a1a1e6fe4\", \"name\": \"get_retail_data\", \"response\": {\"StoreSalesData\": {\"Store\": {\"Products\": [{\"ProductID\": \"P001\", \"Name\": \"Men\\'s Denim Jacket\", \"Category\": \"Men\", \"Price\": 79.99, \"UnitsSold\": 324, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Highly Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P002\", \"Name\": \"Women\\'s Floral Dress\", \"Category\": \"Women\", \"Price\": 49.99, \"UnitsSold\": 512, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Highly Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P003\", \"Name\": \"Unisex White Sneakers\", \"Category\": \"Footwear\", \"Price\": 69.99, \"UnitsSold\": 610, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Highly Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P004\", \"Name\": \"Men\\'s Casual T-Shirt\", \"Category\": \"Men\", \"Price\": 19.99, \"UnitsSold\": 450, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Moderately Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P005\", \"Name\": \"Women\\'s Handbag\", \"Category\": \"Accessories\", \"Price\": 89.99, \"UnitsSold\": 278, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Highly Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P006\", \"Name\": \"Kids\\' Hoodie\", \"Category\": \"Kids\", \"Price\": 29.99, \"UnitsSold\": 198, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Less Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P007\", \"Name\": \"Women\\'s Running Shoes\", \"Category\": \"Footwear\", \"Price\": 59.99, \"UnitsSold\": 431, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Moderately Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P008\", \"Name\": \"Men\\'s Leather Belt\", \"Category\": \"Accessories\", \"Price\": 24.99, \"UnitsSold\": 150, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Less Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P009\", \"Name\": \"Women\\'s Winter Coat\", \"Category\": \"Women\", \"Price\": 129.99, \"UnitsSold\": 95, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Less Profitable\"}, {\"ProductID\": \"P010\", \"Name\": \"Unisex Sports Cap\", \"Category\": \"Accessories\", \"Price\": 14.99, \"UnitsSold\": 310, \"Month\": \"2025-06\", \"ProfitCategory\": \"Moderately Profitable\"}]}}}}}], \"role\": \"user\"}')\n('fashion_advisor', 'test-db-session-01', 'TrendingFashionAgent', '{\"parts\": [{\"function_call\": {\"id\": \"adk-ed8d982e-2559-4768-8b57-e88f169771c9\", \"args\": {\"request\": \"fashion trends and driving factors\"}, \"name\": \"get_latest_trending_fashion_news\"}}], \"role\": \"model\"}')\n('fashion_advisor', 'test-db-session-01', 'RetailDataAgent', '{\"parts\": [{\"text\": \"Okay, I have analyzed the store retail data.
